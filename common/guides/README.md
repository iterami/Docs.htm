`iterami/common` is a code library. Once imported, your projects will have access to functions and variables designed to handle most aspects of project functionality in one standardized way, while also providing additional functionality over vanilla JavaScript.

`iterami/common` functions use one argument object `args` instead of multiple arguments.
